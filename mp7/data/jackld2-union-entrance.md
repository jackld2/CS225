You sit down with some friends in the Union building. You are feeling a bit hungry so you go to the basement food court. You stand in line for Wendy's because you are broke. After approximates 35 minutes, they call you by the wrong name and you come and grab your food. You go back to sit with your friends and you discuss various things about life, such as data structures, or movies you have seen recently. Suddenly, you hear a commotion coming from the student lounge.
