You arrive in the basement and see dozens of students studying and waiting around. There are students forming a line, sleeping in tents and on bedrolls in the hallway. This must be the queue for office hours, for the next MP is due soon. You feel lucky because you find a spot at a table to study. Unfortunately, your laptop is low on batteries and there are only like 2 electric outlets in the entire study area in the computer science building for some reason and they are both in use. You will have to manage.
